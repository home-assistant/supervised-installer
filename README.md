# Install Home Assistant Supervised

This installation method provides the full Home Assistant experience on a regular operating system. This means, all components from the Home Assistant method are used, except for the Home Assistant Operating System. This system will run the Home Assistant Supervisor. The Supervisor is not just an application, it is a full appliance that manages the whole system. It will clean up, repair or reset settings to default if they no longer match expected values.

By not using the Home Assistant Operating System, the user is responsible for making sure that all required components are installed and maintained. Required components and their versions will change over time. Home Assistant Supervised is provided as-is as a foundation for community supported do-it-yourself solutions. We only accept bug reports for issues that have been reproduced on a freshly installed, fully updated Debian with no additional packages.

This method is considered advanced and should only be used if one is an expert in managing a Linux operating system, Docker and networking.



## Installation

Run the following commands as root (`su -` or `sudo su -` on machines with sudo installed):

Step 1: Transition from the default Debian networking service `ifupdown` to NetworkManager and systemd-resolved, run the following commands:

```bash
apt install \
network-manager \
systemd-resolved
```

At this point you won't have Internet access because systemd-resolved doesn't know about your DNS setup. To restore Internet, we need to fully transition the network setup to NetworkManager. There was a hint in the output of the previous command:
```
The following network interfaces were found in /etc/network/interfaces
which means they are currently configured by ifupdown:
- enp1s0
If you want to manage those interfaces with NetworkManager instead
remove their configuration from /etc/network/interfaces.
```

The network interface name might be different depending on your setup. For a default network setup using DHCP the following commands work:

```bash
systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service && \
systemctl disable --now networking.service && \
mv /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces.disabled && \
systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

> [!NOTE]
> Your system might have a new IP address at this point, probably because the DHCP server id used by NetworkManager appears to be different.

Step 2: Install Docker-CE, OS Agent and Supervised dependencies which aren't part of the package dependencies with this command:

```bash
apt install \
curl \
lsb-release \
udisks2
```

Step 3: Install Docker-CE with the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh
```

Step 4: Install the OS-Agent:

Instructions for installing the OS-Agent can be found [here](https://github.com/home-assistant/os-agent/tree/main#using-home-assistant-supervised-on-debian)

Step 5: Install the Home Assistant Supervised Debian Package:

```bash
curl -L -o homeassistant-supervised.deb https://github.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer/releases/latest/download/homeassistant-supervised.deb
apt install ./homeassistant-supervised.deb
```

## Configuration

The default path for our `$DATA_SHARE` is `/var/lib/homeassistant` (used to be `/usr/share/hassio`).
This path is used to store all home assistant related things.

You can reconfigure this path during installation with

```bash
DATA_SHARE=/my/own/homeassistant dpkg --force-confdef --force-confold -i homeassistant-supervised.deb
```

## Troubleshooting

If something's going wrong, use `journalctl -f` to get your system logs. If you are not familiar with Linux and how you can fix issues, we recommend to use our Home Assistant OS.
