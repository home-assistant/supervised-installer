        I encountered an issue when trying to upgrade my existing installation to the Debian package.
        Steps to recreate:
        1. Run the now deprecated installation script
        2. Attempt to upgrade to version 1.0.0 of the Debian package with dpkg -i as root
        3. The install will fail with the error: `dpkg-divert: error: rename involves overwriting`
